The BQ34Z100 is a "gas gauge" battery monitoring chip produced by Texas Instruments. It is primarily used for monitoring lithium ion and lithium ion polymer batteries, and can handle 1-6 
cells. This repository tracks my test code for querying the chip with an Arduino Mega 2560 for the purposes of reading out battery status information.
